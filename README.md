Description:
A Battle Royale mode in the style of Fortnite. This script is very unfinished, with no real logic programmed. It is very basically programmed out, allowing a player to take an M4A1 and to use ramps(commented out of the code due to issues). No real combat was programmed for this mode and as a result is not in a playable state.
